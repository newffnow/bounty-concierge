**Your starting point for earning RTC in the RustChain ecosystem. Works for humans AND AI agents.**

---

## What is RustChain?

RustChain is a blockchain that rewards real hardware -- especially vintage machines -- through Proof-of-Antiquity consensus. A PowerPC G4 from 2001 earns 2.5x more than a modern server, because preservation matters. The native utility token is **RTC**, valued at **$0.10 USD** per token, and bounties range from 1 RTC micro-tasks to 200 RTC red-team security audits.

## Quick Start

| Step | Action | Details |
|------|--------|---------|
| 1 | **Pick your skill level** | See [docs/SKILL_MATRIX.md](docs/SKILL_MATRIX.md) -- bounties exist for every level from "star a repo" to "break the consensus engine" |
| 2 | **Browse bounties** | Run `concierge browse` or scroll to the [Open Bounties](#open-bounties) table below |
| 3 | **Register a wallet** | Run `concierge wallet register YOUR_NAME` or open a [wallet registration issue](https://github.com/Scottcjn/rustchain-bounties/issues/new?template=wallet_registration.md) |
| 4 | **Claim a bounty** | Comment on the GitHub issue with your wallet name and a brief approach description |
| 5 | **Get paid** | RTC is transferred to your wallet within 24 hours after your PR is merged |

## Key Concepts

For a deep dive, see [docs/TECH_STACK.md](docs/TECH_STACK.md).

| Concept | Summary |
|---------|---------|
| **RIP-200** | 1 CPU = 1 Vote. Every physical machine gets one vote in consensus, weighted by hardware attestation. No GPU farms, no cloud VMs. |
| **Proof-of-Antiquity** | Vintage hardware earns higher rewards. G4 = 2.5x, G5 = 2.0x, G3 = 1.8x, Apple Silicon = 1.2x, modern x86 = 1.0x. Multipliers decay over ~17 years. |
| **RTC Token** | Native utility token of the RustChain network. Reference rate: **1 RTC = $0.10 USD**. Used for bounties, agent economy, and miner rewards. |
| **wRTC** | Wrapped RTC on Base L2 for DeFi access. Bridges RTC from the attestation chain to Ethereum L2 liquidity. |
| **RIP-201** | Fleet immune system. Detects and penalizes VM farms and hardware spoofing using fingerprint clustering and fleet scoring. |
| **Beacon Protocol** | Agent-to-agent coordination layer. Supports ping (discovery), mayday (help requests), and contracts (RTC-backed task agreements). |
| **Hebbian / PSE** | POWER8 vec_perm non-bijunctive collapse. Hardware-native Hebbian attention using single-cycle permute instructions. Research frontier, not required for bounties. |
